<p>When we touch a surface or explore an object , both <strong>vision</strong> and <strong>touch</strong> provide information that help us characterise the properties of the surface or the object. The informations gathered by each individual sense have been widely investigated in numerous studies. However, it remains unclear how the information collected by the two modalities are fused together to enable the perception of textures.<p>

<p>We aim to explore how humans perceive visuo-tactile surfaces when the visual and tactile dimensions are <strong>collocated</strong> and during <strong>active</strong> exploration<p>

## Methods

### a. Texture recording

We selected several texture whose vibrotactile signature were recorded using an accelerometer and a force transducer. From those signature, we created a database that will be used in coming psychophysical and electrophysiological studies.

### b. Psychophysics

We used the recorded those tactile signals to perform a serie of psychophysical experiments on visual-haptic interaction.


#### Experiment 1.

Given the limitated capacities of the somatensensory system to discriminate frenquencies, a question raised: Does finger sliding speed influence virtual texture perception on a surface tactile display ? 

To answer this question, we measured the perceptual ability of observers to become aware of the differences in the textures corresponding to different scanning speed during active sliding on a touchscreen.

#### Experiment 2.

In this experiment, participant were seated in front of a touchscreen. They were presented with a pair of visual signals and a pair of tactile signals, one of them being the signal corresponding to the visual texture displayed and the other one being the signal of another texture. They were asked to pick which of the two vibrations they thought best matches the visual feedback.
