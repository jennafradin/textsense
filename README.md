# TextSense projet

When we explore a surface or an object , both vision and touch provide information that help us characterise the properties of the surface or the object. The informations gathered by each individual sense have been widely investigated in numerous studies. However,it remains unclear how the information collected by the two modalities are fused together to enable the perception of textures. To fill this gap, we prpose an original approach that aims to create a **new dataset** of visuo-haptic textures recorded with the **bare finger**, which fill be used to perform psychophysical experiments and electrophysiological reocrdings.

## Texture recording

In the first part, we selected several texture whose vibrotactile signature were recorded. From those signature, we created a database that will be used in coming psychophysical and electrophysiological studies. 

## Pilot experiments

### Haptic feedback 

We used the tactile signal recorded to set up a psychophysical experiment on **haptic feedback**. Using a tactile actuator, the participant were asked to compare two successive vibrations for each trial. After the trial, they answered whether the vibrations were "same" or "different". The results showed that people mostly felt the difference across rendered textures when played by the vibrotactile actuator.

### Exploration speed

Given the limitated capacities of the somatensensory system to discriminate frenquencies, a question raised: Does finger sliding speed influence virtual texture perception on a surface tactile display ?
