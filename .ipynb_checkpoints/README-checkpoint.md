# TextSense projet

When we explore a surface or an object , both vision and touch provide information that help us characterise the properties of the surface or the object. The informations gathered by each individual sense have been widely investigated in numerous studies. However,it remains unclear how the information collected by the two modalities are fused together to enable the perception of textures. To fill this gap, we prpose an original approach that aims to create a **new dataset** of visuo-haptic textures recorded with the **bare finger**, which fill be used to perform psychophysical experiments and electrophysiological reocrdings.

## Texture recording

In the first part, we recorded tactile interaction with everyday fabric in order to manipulate and be able to use these recordings in psychophysical tasks. 


## Pilot experiments

### Haptic feedback 

We used the tactile signal recorded to set up a psychophysical experiment on haptic feedback. Using a tactile actuator, the participant were asked to compare two successive vibrations for each trial. After the trial, they answered whether the vibrations were "same" or "different". All possible pairs of textures were repated 10 times in a pseudo-randomized order.
